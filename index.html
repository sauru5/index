<p class="blackgoblins">In April, both the United States and the Democratic Republic of Korea made formal requests to SAARC to be granted observer status. The European Union also expressed interest in receiving observer status and is expected to make a formal request to the SAARC Council of Ministers at its forthcoming meeting in July.
The first SAARC Conference of Home Ministers convened in Dhaka on 11 May. The agenda was dominated by issues of terrorism and the trafficking of humans and drugs. Ministers adopted a nine point resolution to fight terrorism and drug trafficking in the region by expediting the existing SAARC mechanism and sharing information and experiences among member states. They committed to strengthen cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Ministers discussed steps taken by member countries to implement two SAARC conventions related to terrorism and drug abuse, as well as methods to execute the Additional Protocol on the Financing of Terrorism. A proposal to establish a regional law enforcement agency—SAARCPOL—was referred to ministers for further study. The proposal will be discussed at the 2nd Home Ministers' meeting scheduled to convene in India in 2007, after a meeting of SAARC police chiefs in Pakistan in December 2006.</p>

<p>The 24th meeting of the SAARC Council of Ministers convened in Islamabad, Pakistan from 2-3 January. The Ministers reached a consensus regarding the text of an Additional Protocol to the 1987 SAARC Regional Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism which addresses issues involving the funding of terrorism. The Protocol was designed to strengthen the Convention "by criminalizing the provision, collection or acquisition of funds for the purpose of committing terrorist acts" and by increasing efforts to prevent the financing of terrorism. Specifically, it encourages States to hold individuals or groups that have committed terrorist-related offenses liable domestically, and to implement practical measures and adapt domestic legislation to prevent and suppress terrorist financing. The Ministers also adopted several other documents, including the final draft of a document establishing a South Asian Free Trade Area and a Social Charter.
The Council of Ministers meeting was directly followed by the Twelfth SAARC Summit of the Heads of State and Government, which convened, also in Islamabad, from 4-6 January. At the Summit, leaders addressed means of increasing regional cooperation in the areas of economics; poverty alleviation; science and technology development; social, cultural and environmental issues; and terrorism prevention. They signed the Additional Protocol to the SAARC Regional Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism approved days earlier by the Council of Ministers. It will enter into force 30 days after the final instrument of ratification is deposited. Furthermore, counter- terrorism was a major topic addressed in the Summit Declaration. Heads of State and Government condemned terrorist violence in all forms and stated that terrorism continues to be a major threat in South Asia, as well as a challenge to all States worldwide. They also stressed that terrorism violates the United Nations and SAARC charters and reaffirmed their commitment to the SAARC Regional Convention on Suppression on Terrorism in addition to other relevant international conventions to which they are party.</p>

<p>The 22nd session of the Council of Ministers was held from 2-3 January in Kathmandu, Nepal. Among other topics, the ministers discussed implementation of the SAARC Regional Convention on Terrorism, stressing its significance in light of recent developments. They additionally issued recommendations on a range of other topics to the 11th Summit.
The 11th SAARC Summit was convened in Kathmandu on 4-6 January. In the Summit declaration, the Heads of State or Government were of the view that stability, peace, and security in South Asia should be promoted together with efforts to improve the global security environment. They underscored their commitment to general and complete disarmament including nuclear disarmament on a universal basis, under effective international control. They agreed that global nonproliferation goals could not be achieved in the absence of progress towards nuclear disarmament and in this context called upon all nuclear weapon States (NWS), whether party or non-party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), to engage constructively through a transparent and credible process of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament (CD). The leaders also recognized the linkage between disarmament and development.
The Heads of State or Government recognized that due to their particular vulnerability, small States require special measures for support from the international community for the safeguarding of their sovereign independence and territorial integrity. They reiterated that the real protection of small States should be firmly rooted in the scrupulous adherence to the UN Charter, and the rule of law and the strict adherence to universally accepted principles and norms related to sovereign rights and territorial integrity of all States, irrespective of size.</p>

<h1><a name="10 summit"></a>1998</h1>
<img src="maldives.png"/>
<p>In the declaration of the <span>10th SAARC Summit</span> in July, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the Member States were of the view that stability, peace, and security in South Asia could not be considered in isolation from global security environment. They noted that the great power rivalry, which the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) had consistently opposed, no longer posed a serious threat and the danger of a global nuclear conflagration had abated. However, some States still sought to maintain huge arsenals of nuclear weapons and the NPT and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), to which some SAARC Members were signatories, had not led to any progress towards nuclear disarmament nor prevented proliferation. The Member States underscored their commitment to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and the need for promoting nuclear disarmament on a universal basis, under effective international control. They recognized that global nonproliferation goals could not be achieved in the absence of progress towards nuclear disarmament and in this context called upon all NWS, whether party or non-party to the NPT, to engage constructively through a transparent and credible process of negotiations at the CD. The Member States urged the CD to commence negotiations on a comprehensive, universal, and non-discriminatory international instrument prohibiting the use or the threat of nuclear weapons as well as eliminating such weapons in existing arsenals.</p>

<h1><a name="9th summit"></a>1997</h1>
<img src="bangladesh.png"/>
<p>In the declaration of the Ninth SAARC Summit in May, in Malé, Maldives, the Member States recognized the need for the international community to pursue nuclear disarmament as a matter of highest priority. In this regard, they recognized the need to start negotiations through the CD and to establish a phased program for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a specified framework of time, including a Nuclear Weapons Convention.</p>

<h1><a name="8th summit"></a>1995</h1>
<img src="india.gif"/>
<p>In the declaration of the Eighth SAARC Summit in May 1995, in New Delhi, India, the Member States noted that while the international community had successfully created a norm against chemical and biological weapons, it had, unfortunately, been unable to do the same with regard to nuclear weapons. They expressed the conviction that more needed to be done and at a far greater pace. They reiterated that the utmost priority was to be given to nuclear disarmament, given the danger posed by nuclear weapons. The Member States urged the CD to negotiate an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances and to undertake negotiations for the complete elimination of all nuclear weapons within a specified period of time.</p>

<h1><a name="7th summit"></a>1993</h1>
<img src="india.gif"/>
<p>In the declaration of the Seventh SAARC Summit in April, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Member States noted a number of recent positive developments in the area of nuclear, chemical, and conventional disarmament, including the agreements on bilateral arms reductions between the United States and Russia. They expressed their hope that the implementation of the far-reaching arms reduction agreed to in the Washington Agreement of June 1992 and START II signed in Moscow in January 1993 would be successfully carried out. The Member States urged all NWS to collectively endeavor to attain the ultimate goal of complete elimination of nuclear arsenals in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h1><a name="6th summit"></a>1991</h1>
<img src="Srilanka.png" height="150"/>
<p>In the declaration of the Sixth SAARC Summit in December, in Colombo, Sri Lanka, the Member States assessed current international developments in the political sphere particularly those that affected the lives of the people of South Asia. They noted the changing power structures in international relations and the reduction of confrontations and tensions, particularly among the United States and USSR. These have contributed to the receding of the threat of nuclear confrontation and to agreements on disarmament measures. The Member States hoped that these developments would restrain the pursuit of military power in all areas of the world and expressed hope thaessed concern at the deteriorating international political situation and the unprecedented escalation of the arms race, particularly in its nuclear aspect. They recognized that mankind was confronted with the threat of self-extinction arising from a massive accumulation of the most destructive weapons ever produced and that the arms race intensified international tension and violated the principles of the UN Charter. </p>
